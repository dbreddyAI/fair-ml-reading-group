# Fair ML Reading Group 2019
üåç Melbourne, Australia  
üè† Hosted by [Silverpond](https://silverpond.com.au/)  
ü§ñ Facilitated by (Laura)[https://twitter.com/summerscope]

## Description
We're a multi-disciplinary group reading papers on the topic of fairness and ethics in Machine Learning and Data Science. Our syllabus so far has been setting the scene and getting a feeling for the overall approaches.  We'll be doing some deep diving into specific approaches in the months to come.
